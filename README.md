# Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction

This project aims to predict the poverty level of households in Costa Rica using machine learning techniques. The dataset used is from the Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction competition hosted on Kaggle by the Inter-American Development Bank. This is an upload of the jupyter notebooks done, any code, analysis and results, can be found on them.

## Dataset

The dataset contains socio-economic and demographic information from a survey of households in Costa Rica, conducted by the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INEC). The target variable is the poverty level, which is categorized into four groups:

1. Extreme Poverty
2. Moderate Poverty 
3. Vulnerable Households
4. Non-Vulnerable Households

The dataset includes 142 features, such as:
- Household characteristics (e.g., number of bedrooms, walls material)
- Family composition (e.g., number of family members, children, elderly)
- Head of household attributes (e.g., age, education level, marital status) 
- Asset ownership (e.g., dwelling, appliances, vehicles)

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis to gain insights into the data and its relationships.
3. **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for predicting the target variable using statistical and machine learning techniques.
4. **Modeling**: Implementing and comparing various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
5. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing the model hyperparameters using techniques like Grid Search and Random Search.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.
7. **Model Interpretation**: Analyzing the feature importances and understanding the factors contributing to household poverty.
